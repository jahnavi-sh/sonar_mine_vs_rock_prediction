# sonar_mine_vs_rock_prediction
SONAR is a device used in submarines to detect object underwater. Based on the data provided, the project is to build a machine learning algorithm that detect and discriminate between the sonar signals bounced off a mine and those bounced off a rock. This project illustrates the use of logistic regression as a binary classifier algorithm.
